  <h2 id="where-do-i-even-begin">Where Do I Even Begin?</h2>

<p>Computers have always fascinated me and it was first sparked by my hobby and interest in video games. Watching as lines upon lines of written code can come together to create experiences that I will remember for the rest of my life and the ability to share that with others is amazing. As I gone through highschool I ended up deciding upon Computer Engineering as my major as the components of a computer fascinated me along with the software side.</p>

<h2 id="interest-in-software-engineering">Interest in Software Engineering</h2>

<p>Software Engineering allows for a lot more expression of creativity, I think. I am familiar with programming in C, C++, and Java with Javascript being another language on the list to learn. I think that learning a new coding language is a fun experience where I can find similarities and differences between the previous languages and see what was lacking or improved upon when moving to another.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-end-goal">Whatâ€™s The End Goal?</h2>

<p>In the future I hope to improve the speed at which I code because I am noticing that I take my time way too much when projects come around and I now realize how much time I am wasting. When entering the work force as a Computer Engineer I am going to face situations where clients will push a time table that requires faster and cleaner code and I hope to get in that practice right now. Making sure that the code that I write is commented on and is readable to other people is another future goal as I realize that I will almost never be writing just for myself and that code will need to be shared between multiple people and peers. Being clear and concise is something that I can use in every aspect of my life.</p>
