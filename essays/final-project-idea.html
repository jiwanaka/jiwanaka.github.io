  <h1>Project: Video Game Connect</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The problem: Video games have become progressively more popular as the years have gone by and now the majority of people play or at least know about video games. Socializing can be hard when it comes to this medium and finding people you can interact with and connect to can be even harder. </p>

<p>The solution: Video Game Connect allows a way for people to find others who can share the similar timed sessions with, the frequency at which they can play, the type of environment they want to surround themself with (competitive or casual), etc.</p>

<h2>Approach</h2>

<p>To use Video Game Connect, a user must login and create their profile that will list generally how often they play during the week, the types of games they prefer to play, the times at which they can actively play, and whether they want a casual or competitive environment. As gaming is slightly anonymous the user would have to input their discord information so there is a way contact the individual. If there are people who already have friends and just want more members for certain game activities then they can adjust their profile to state how many people they are looking for and how many people they already have.</p>

<p>You can also set up tournament registration posts that multiple people can sign up for. There will be a calender page unique for each user that will take the times displayed by the user that they favorite or tournaments that they apply for and will display said times on the calender. Administrators have the ability to remove posts if they are seen as inappropriate or edit posts and/or user info. </p>

<h2>Mockup Page Ideas</h2>
<li>Navbar</li>
<li>Landing Page</li>
<li>Login page for admins and users</li>
<li>Admin Page</li>
<li>Calender Page</li>
<li>Tournament submission form</li>
<li>Calender Page</li>
<li>Profile Page</li>

<h2>Case Ideas</h2>

<li>New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile.</li>
<li>Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site.</li>
<li>User goes to landing page, logs in, signs up for tournament</li>
<li>User goes to landing page, logs in, creates tournament information and sign up page</li>

<h2>Beyond the basics</h2>

<p>After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features: </p>

<li>An on-site messaging system that does not require discord with notification system warning when tournaments happen or when a favorited user can play</li>
<li>A rating system for users</li>
